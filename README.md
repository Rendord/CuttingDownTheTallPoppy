# CuttingDownTheTallPoppy
"Cutting down a tall poppy" refers to intense scrutiny and criticism of successful people. It reminded me of the phenomena of crabs in a bucket. It is represented in this Unity project by a ball traversing the seasons experiencing ups and downs. As time passes and the world watches, the ball is cut down by a crab down below.
